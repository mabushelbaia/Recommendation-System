\section{Recommendation Systems}\label{sec:recommendation-systems}
A recommendation system is an artificial intelligence (AI) technology that provides users with recommendations for items that they may be interested in using Big Data and machine learning techniques. 

Recommender systems undergo training to understand the prefrences, earlier decisions, and attributes of the user and products using thier past intractions which includes impressions, clicks, purchases, and ratings. Recommender systems are usally used by content and product providers to suggest items to users that they may like based on their profile and preferences.
