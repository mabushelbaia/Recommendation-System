\section{Recommendation Systems}\label{sec:recommendation-systems}
"A recommendation system is an artificial intelligence or AI algorithm, usually associated with machine learning, that uses Big Data to suggest or recommend additional products to consumers. These can be based on various criteria, including past purchases, search history, demographic information, and other factors."\cite{NvidiaRecSys} \\ \\
Recommender systems undergo training to understand the preferences, earlier decisions, and attributes of the user and products using their past interactions which includes impressions, clicks, purchases, and ratings. Recommender systems are usually used by content and product providers to suggest items to users that they may like based on their profile and preferences. 

\section{Types of Recommendation Systems}\label{sec:types-of-recommendation-systems}

\subsection{Context Filtering}
Context Filtering is a technique that uses the contextual information of the user by framing the recommendation problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem and using the contextual information to learn the user's preferences.

\subsection{Variational Autoencoder for Collaborative Filtering}
This model consists of two parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes the user's preferences as input and encodes them into a latent space. The decoder takes the latent space as input and decodes it into the item's features.

\subsection{Collaborative Filtering}
Collaborative Filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user. It looks at the items they like and combines them to create a ranked list of suggestions. This technique is based on the idea that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future.

\subsection{Content Filtering}
Content Filtering is a technique that uses the features of items a user has interacted with to recommend more items with similar features. This technique is based on the idea that if a customer showed interest in a particular product, he will also be interested in a similar product. \\

\subsection{Hybrid Recommendation Systems}
Hybrid Recommendation Systems combine the advantages of multiple types of recommendation algorithms to create a more comprehensive recommending system.
\subsection{Neural Collaborative Filtering}
A technique that uses neural networks to learn the customer's preferences and recommend items. It uses a neural network to learn the user's preferences and a neural network to learn the item's features. The two networks are then combined to create a recommendation.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Contextual Sequence Learning}
Contextual Sequence Learning is a technique that uses a recurrent neural network to learn the user's preferences and a neural network to learn the item's features. The two networks are then combined to create a recommendation.
\subsection{Wide \& Deep}
Wide \& Deep is a technique that uses a wide neural network to learn the preferences of the customer and utilizes another deep neural network to learn the products's features. The wide model is generalized linear model (GLM) and the deep model is a dense neural network (DNN).

\subsection{DLRM}
Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) it is a technique that uses a deep neural network to handle categorical and numerical features. each categorical feature is represented as a one-hot vector and each numerical feature is represented as a dense vector, both fed into multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers. The output of the MLP layers is then fed into a dot product layer to compute the inner product of the feature vectors. The output of the dot product layer is then fed into a sigmoid layer to compute the probability of the user liking the item.
