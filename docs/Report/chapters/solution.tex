* Terminology: The item is now a product, and the user is now a customer of an e-commerce platform

\subsection{System Components}


* API gateway
    * data ingestion
    * adding new customers, items, and interaction endpoints 
    * getting recommendations for a customer endpoint [ and how it first queries the caching layer and then the recommendation pipeline]
* Recommendation Pipeline ( all the stages )
    * Retrieval
    * Filtering
    * Scoring
    * Ordering
* Caching Layer
* Automation and DevOps
* Components Deployment ( ECS or Kubernetes, SageMaker or Triton Inference Server, Redis or Memcached, which feature store )?



\subsection{Two Tower Model (Retrieval Stage)}

* embedding store?
* choosing a ranking model and explaining it

TODO 

\subsection{Filtering Stage}

TODO
* Explaining the E-commerce business logic


\subsection{Deep Learning Ranking Model (Scoring Stage)}

* feature store 
* choosing a ranking model and explaining it
* storing model parameters?


TODO

\subsection{E-commerce ordering logic (Ordering Stage)}

* add additional business logic like promoting items (sponsored items), write an equation for the final score ( maybe ranking score + 0.2 for sponsored items or put sponsored items on top of the list if they exceed a certain threshold score)

TODO

\subsection{Storing Results (Caching Layer)}

* Redis or any memory store

TODO

\subsection{Deployment of components ?}
